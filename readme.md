**PC Guessing**

PC players will randomly choose a coordinate pair on the opposing player's game board that has not yet been fired at. In the event of a hit, the PC player will add the adjacent (not yet fired upon) 4 coordinate pairs to a queue. When another hit occurs along the same ship's segment, the adjacent (4 - 1) coordinate pairs are added to the queue. Random guessing occurs again once an entire ship of the opponent's board is hit and surrounded by misses.
